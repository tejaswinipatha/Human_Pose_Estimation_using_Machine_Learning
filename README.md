# Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

This project focuses on Human Pose Estimation using machine learning, leveraging Mediapipeâ€™s BlazePose model for detecting key body landmarks. The system processes images, videos, or real-time webcam input to identify human poses, enhancing applications in fitness tracking, motion analysis, and interactive AI systems. Implemented using OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Streamlit, the project provides an efficient and user-friendly approach to real-time pose detection and analysis.

The pose detection model processes the input, detects human body landmarks, and draws them on the image or video. If using a webcam, the system continuously processes frames in real-time.

# 🤖 Human Pose Estimation using Machine Learning

This project is a real-time Human Pose Estimation system built using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Streamlit. It leverages powerful machine learning models to detect and visualize 33 human body landmarks with high accuracy.

Whether you're working with a single image, a video clip, or using a live webcam feed, this tool can:

🧍‍♂️ Recognize human poses and skeletal joints (like elbows, knees, shoulders, hips, etc.)

🧠 Understand posture and motion through visual feedback

🧩 Help in applications such as:

Fitness tracking & pose correction<br/>
Yoga posture analysis<br/>
Rehabilitation monitoring<br/>
Interactive AI games or experiences<br/>
Animation & motion capture

<br>
